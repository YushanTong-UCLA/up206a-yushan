**Geospatial Data Science and Its application in solving real-world problems**

[Blogpost](https://blog.gramener.com/spatial-data-science-use-cases/)

I chose the blog post by Gramner on geospatial data science because it provided me with a clear definition of the topic, which was followed up with three examples of application of data science in real world. The geospatial data science is defined as "a subset of data science, that comprises location analytics, satellite imagery, remote sensing, analyzing projection systems, and analyzing raster and vector data." Geospatial data scientists apply the above techniques to analyze the base geospatial datasets to explore the reason behind phenomena observed in the datasets. Geospatial data science helps fill in the gap of *what* is happening, and *why* it's happening and *how*.Geospatial data science has a broad application in real world. Urban planners, epidemiologists, farmers, goverment, etc., are increasingly depending on the analysis of geospatial data science to make critical decisions to improve human life quality. 

From the blog post, I am inspired to think beyond the traditional data analyzing tools such as Stata, SPSS, and Excel to incorporate the spatial component in my project. During my first quarter at UCLA, I was researching about travel bahavior of senior Asian Americans in LA County, especially their use of public transit. I would love to apply Python and other techniques I will learn in this course to expand my analysis of datasets. For this course, I would love to discover and work on a project that would allow me to gain insights and grow knowledge of applying spatial data science. I hope I can expand the function of existing datasets in transportation profession and give them new life by using spatial data science to analyze them.
