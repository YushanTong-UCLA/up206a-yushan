I read Professor Millard-Ball's *The value of residential streets*. In the article, Professor Millard-Ball discussed the street width requirement in cities and housing availability. Professor Millard-Ball argued the city should consider narrow the streets where the land could be more productive to use as the part of the abutting parcel, to develop new construction project so to decrease housing price or develop more affordable housing units. 

Professor Millard-Ball examined various values of streets, including access value, movement value, storage value, and some other values (social and play spaces). By using GIS data, professor Millard-Ball examined the residential streets width change and land value in 16, out of 20,  largest cities in the US. The results suggest that the streets in the US are too wide, and there is an overabundance of land being devoted to the street right-of-way. And as a result, the housing costs rise and the densities are constrained due to the lack of housing. There is a need to re-allocate the street space to encourage housing development.
